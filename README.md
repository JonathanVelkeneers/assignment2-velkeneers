## 4 Foods and drinks to try

1. Belgian waffles: By far the best waffles anywhere in the world, usually served with ice cream of whipped cream.
2. Belgian beer: If you are of legal drinking age, going to Belgium and trying different beers is a must. There is a wide variety of lagers and "Trippels".
3. Belgian fries: If you live in America, you've never eater real fries in the way they're supposed to be made. Visit belgium and try some.
4. Water: A lot of people drink way too much soda or other drinks, just drinking water once in a while can do you some good.
